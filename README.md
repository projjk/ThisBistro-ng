I learned how Angular works and how it communicates with the backend APIs developed with ASP.NET Core Web API. While working on this project, I also learned about RxJs, different HTTP methods and status codes, various CSS frameworks, containerizing with Docker, and AWS services for deployment.

The backend is also designed to accomodate further implementation of Swagger and Auth0.
